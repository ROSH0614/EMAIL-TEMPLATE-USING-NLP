Noticed you've been running several experiments to grow your email lists. <br/><br/>Here are a few lesser-used strategies that drive explosive growth: <br/><br/>- Members only bonus area: You offer a lot of juicy bonuses to entice new signups. There doesn't seem to be a way for existing members to also receive them right now. Think creating a members-only bonus area where existing subscribers can go to download your latest goodies would go long ways to build their long-term loyalty.- Behavior settings on your opt-in box: Noticed your opt-in box still pops up for people who already subscribed. You can use a much longer-lasting cookie to stop it from annoying your existing subscribers. <br/><br/>I've been coding for the last several years with a focus on building viral growth engines.

"<p>Hi {name}, I understand you may currently be using Pardot as a marketing tool, and I was wondering if you’re experiencing any difficulty with it. Pardot users often find that they need a more scalable solution as their business grows, and as a result, we’ve seen many customers switch to Marketo in recent months. These customers see immediate increases of 30-100% in productivity and a dramatic increase in leads – purely because they get much more capability in an easier-to-use package. <br/><br/>Why are Pardot users switching? Marketo removes the limitations that held them back – some of the major benefits that these customers have experienced with Marketo include: A much more productive, intuitive, and flexible interface for creating marketing campaigns (ranked #1 for user experience by independent analysts) Ability to quickly report on pipeline, revenue, and ROI by a marketing campaign or channel Flexible lead scoring – which includes scoring models by product line or division, and automatic score reductions when your leads are inactive Drastically improved ability to leverage lead intelligence solutions inside your CRM For a limited time, we are also offering special pricing packages to make switching incredibly easy and attractive. <br/><br/>Please reply to this email or click here if you’d like to set up a time to talk about whether Marketo makes sense for your business.

"<p>No worries... the short answer is no, we aren't able to compete on price against FooCorp.<br/><br/>The FooCorps of the world have spent a couple of decades now in a race to the bottom and it shows. I have no doubt you can get their product (or a whole raft of others) for a few bucks cheaper than us.<br/><br/>Our product, Acme, is different. We're designed to help improve your company's performance in the critical area of XYZ. The ROI on doing that is enormous.<br/><br/>Now, not every organization sees the value in investing in XYZ. I get that. But if yours does, Acme is one of the most leveraged investments you can make.<br/><br/>Assume HelloSign does 5-6 transactions in the [XYZ field], that's going to run 300-600k per year (so figure this is a $1-2MM investment over 3 years). The value of each transaction will be maybe 2-5x that if they're done well, whereas a bad one we know can actually destroy value.<br/><br/>On the cost side, great transactions churn over at less than half the rate of low-performing ones - which means if you do a better job at XYZ, you'll save 10's of thousands in new transaction costs as they stay longer. And on and on....<br/><br/>So ultimately if you think Acme will help you do this better - even just a little bit - the whole thing is peanuts. The cost difference between our product and the others, even less.<br/><br/>Look, FooCorp's customers are switching to Acme in droves because we're investing heavily in great customer service and innovation. Those things cost money but, as we see above, they drive tons of value so the market is happy to pay.<br/><br/>We'd love to have HelloSign on board as a customer and I'd be happy to have another chat with you or them if you think it would be useful.
